# Since we make use of XZ compression method (which seems to be the most
# efficient compression method) for the kernel modules in the CLIP OS kernel
# configuration, we need to make sure that the library and tools for managing
# linux kernel modules (i.e. kmod) has the LZMA support (XZ is part of the LZMA
# compression algorithms):
