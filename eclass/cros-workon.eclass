# CLIP-OS-related alteration to this eclass:
# Some adaptation have been made to fit the structure of the CLIP OS source
# tree and to remove unused variables and features.

# @ECLASS: cros-workon.eclass
# @BLURB: helper eclass for building CoreOS SDK provided source
# @DESCRIPTION:
# Instead of cloning git trees directly from github ebuilds can fetch
# from the local cache maintained by repo. Additionally live builds can
# build directly from the source checked out in the repo tree.

# @ECLASS-VARIABLE: CROS_WORKON_REPO
# @DESCRIPTION:
# Git URL which is prefixed to CROS_WORKON_PROJECT
: "${CROS_WORKON_REPO:=/mnt/src}"

# @ECLASS-VARIABLE: CROS_WORKON_PROJECT
# @DESCRIPTION:
# Git project name which is suffixed to CROS_WORKON_REPO
: "${CROS_WORKON_PROJECT:=${PN}}"

# @ECLASS-VARIABLE: CROS_WORKON_LOCALDIR
# @DESCRIPTION:
# Repo checkout directory which is prefixed to CROS_WORKON_LOCALNAME
# CLIP: It is usually either external or platform.

# @ECLASS-VARIABLE: CROS_WORKON_COMMIT
# @DESCRIPTION:
# Git commit to checkout to
