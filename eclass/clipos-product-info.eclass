# @DESCRIPTION:
# Instead of hardcoding product information such as product names in ebuilds,
# extract them from the product.toml file through environment variables.

# Extract a key from the current product properties passed through the
# environment variable set CURRENT_PRODUCT_PROPERTIES and
# CURRENT_PRODUCT_PROPERTY_*. These environment variables are produced by the
# cosmk utility which has serialized the "properties.toml" file beforehand.
